# Videos for getting started with EOP

The following series of videos will help you set up and use the Exchange Online Protection (EOP) hosted email filtering service.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Before you start the tasks described in the videos, we recommend that you set up mail flow. For more information, see the [Configure mail flow using connectors in Office 365](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/854b5a50-4462-4836-a092-37e208d29624.aspx) topic. 
  
These videos are about tailoring your anti-spam settings to fit the needs of your organization. For inbound mail traveling through the service to your organization, this includes creating safe sender and blocked sender lists based on IP addresses, and configuring content filter settings. There's also a video showing how admins can find and release content-filtered spam messages or messages that matched a transport rule that were sent to the quarantine, and also how to report spam messages to help us improve the service.
