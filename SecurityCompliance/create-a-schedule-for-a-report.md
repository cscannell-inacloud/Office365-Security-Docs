In the Security &amp; Compliance Center, several [reports and insights](reports-and-insights-in-security-and-compliance.md) are available to help your organization's security team mitigate and address threats to your organization. If you're a member of your organization's security team, you can create a schedule for a report. The schedule you create can include a custom date ranges to suit your organization.

    If you choose to customize your report schedule, you can specify the report's frequency, a sender's email address, and a recipient's email address. 
    
Once you have created a schedule for a report, that report will be delivered via email to recipients' emali addresses automatically.
