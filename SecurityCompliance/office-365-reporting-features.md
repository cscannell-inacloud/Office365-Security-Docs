# Office 365 Reporting Features 

## Introduction
The Reports feature provides a variety of audit reports for Azure Active Directory (AD), Exchange Online, device management, supervisory review, and data loss prevention (DLP). These are different and separate from the Office 365 Activity Reports.

## Office 365 Reports Dashboard
The Reports dashboard in the Office 365 Admin center preview displays usage activity across Office 365. Office 365 global administrators, or an Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, or Skype for Business administrator, can get granular insight into the usage of that service. Reports can provide insights such as the number of users consuming a particular Office 365 service, the number of users that have activated Office Professional Plus, and how much mail is flowing through the organization. Reports are available for the last 7, 30, 90, and 180 days.

The following reports are available:

## Azure Active Directory Reports
Office 365 uses Azure AD for authentication and identity management. Office 365 administrators can use the reports generated by Azure to look for unusual activity and unauthorized access to their data. You can use the access and usage reports in Azure AD to gain visibility into the integrity and security of your organization's directory. With this information, an administrator can better determine where possible security risks may be so that they can adequately plan to mitigate those risks.

Azure AD reports can be exported to Microsoft Excel and correlated with other data from Office 365, such as the results of an audit log search, to provide insight into access, authentication, and application-level activities. Advanced anomaly and resource usage reports are available when Azure AD Premium is enabled. These advanced reports help to improve an organization's security posture and help organizations respond to potential threats by leveraging analytics about device access and application usage. For more information, see the [Azure Active Directory Reporting Guide](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-reporting-guide/).

## Exchange Online Audit Reports
Exchange Online audit reports include details on mailbox access and changes made by administrators to an organization's Exchange Online tenant. Once mailbox auditing is enabled, you can use the tasks in the following table to run reports and export Exchange Online audit logs.

>**NOTE**: You must [enable mailbox audit logging](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn879651.aspx) for each mailbox so that audited events are saved in the audit log for that mailbox. If mailbox audit logging isn't enabled for a mailbox, events for that mailbox won't be saved in the audit log and won't appear in mailbox audit reports. For more information, see [enable mailbox auditing](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn879651.aspx).

| Task | Description |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Run a non-owner mailbox access report](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj150575(v=exchg.150).aspx) | Displays the list of mailboxes that have been accessed by someone other than the owner of the mailbox. The report contains information about who accessed the mailbox, the actions they took in the mailbox, and whether the actions were successful. |
| [Export mailbox audit logs](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj150552(v=exchg.150).aspx) | Mailbox audit logs contain information on access and actions in a mailbox taken by a user other than the mailbox owner. Administrators can specify mailboxes along with a date range to generate reports. The logs are exported in XML, attached to a message and sent to specific users as determined by the administrator. |
| [Run an administrator role group report](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/library/jj723121(v=exchg.150).aspx) | The administrator role group is used to assign administrative privileges to users. These privileges allow users to perform administrative tasks such as reset passwords, create or modify mailboxes, and assign admin privileges to other users. The admin role group report shows changes to role groups, including the addition or removal of members. |
| [View the admin audit log](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn342832(v=exchg.150).aspx) | The admin audit log report lists all create, update and delete functions performed by administrators in Exchange Online. Log entries provide information on which cmdlet was run, what parameters were used, who ran the cmdlet, and what objects were affected. |
| [Mailbox content search and hold](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/library/ms.exch.eac.DiscoverySearchChangesLearnMore(EXCHG.150).aspx) | Provides details of any changes to In-Place eDiscovery or In-Place Hold settings on mailboxes. |
| [Export the admin audit log](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/library/c7188d53-e672-492b-b57d-cd711379ddb3(v=exchg.150)#EACAdminReport) | The admin audit log records specific administrative actions such as create, update and delete in Exchange Online. The results from the log are exported to XML and administrators can choose to send this log to a set of users. |
| [Run a per-mailbox litigation hold report](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj150542(v=exchg.150).aspx) | Provides details of any changes to litigation hold settings on mailboxes. |
| [View and export the external admin audit log](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn505728(v=exchg.150).aspx) | Contains details of actions performed by external administrators. The entries provide information on which cmdlet was run, what parameters were used, and any actions that create, modify or delete objects in Exchange Online. |

## Device Compliance Reports
You can manage and secure mobile devices when they're connected to your Office 365 organization by using Office 365 Mobile Device Management (MDM). Mobile devices like smartphones and tablets that are used to access work email, calendar, contacts, and documents play a big part in making sure that employees are able to work anytime, and from anywhere. As a result, it's critical that you protect your organization's information. You can use Office 365 MDM to set device security policies and access rules, and to wipe mobile devices if they're lost or stolen.

MDM compliance reports provide an overview of policies that have been set up by an organization to secure mobile devices that are accessing Office 365 data. The report allows filtering of devices by compliance status, reported violations, blocked devices, and how many devices were wiped as a result of security policies. For more information, see [Overview of Mobile Device Management for Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/Overview-of-Mobile-Device-Management-for-Office-365-faa7d8e5-645d-4d59-839c-c8d4c1869e4a).

## Data Loss Prevention
DLP policies help manage the security and flow of information in an organization. You can set up policies to block access to content, encrypt data, or notify users of policy and policy violations using in-application DLP Policy Tips. DLP reports provide insight into the number of policy and rule matches, overrides, and false positives.

You can use the Office 365 admin center to view information about the number of messages that are detected by your DLP policies in either graphical chart or table format. Specifically, DLP policy matches for sent and received mail, and DLP rule matches for sent and received mail. You can also view the number of matches, overrides, and false positives for each policy within the past 24 hours using the Exchange admin center. However, this data is not available as a chart. If you download a report for use in Excel, you can view even more detail, such as who sent which message, on what day, and what policy matches were triggered. For more information, see [View reports about DLP policy detections](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj889415(v=exchg.150).aspx).

## Auditing in Yammer Enterprise
Yammer Enterprise provides administrators with the ability to export user activity data from their Yammer network(s) via the [Yammer Data Export API](https://about.yammer.com/success/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2013/01/Data-Export-API.pdf), or manually via the Yammer network admin page. The ability to export logs is restricted to Network Administrators in Yammer. (All Office 365 global administrators are Yammer Network Administrators.)

The following data can be exported:

| Filename | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Users.csv | All new, pending, and suspended users in the network |
| Messages.csv | All messages in the network |
| Files.csv (metadata) | Metadata such as filename, file API URL, uploader ID, uploaded at, etc. |
| Files.csv (Original files) | Zip file of the original files that were uploaded by users into Yammer |
| Topics.csv | Topics created on the network |
| Pages.csv | Pages (notes) created by users in the network |
| Admins.csv | All verified administrators on the network |
| Networks.csv | All Yammer external networks |

*Table 3 - Yammer network data files available for export by customers*

Yammer Enterprise data is also available through the Office 365 Activity Reports. In addition, Yammer is actively working on exposing additional logging via the Office 365 Management Activity API, and on the ability to reason over data using Power BI. See the [Office Roadmap](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/roadmap?filters=yammer) for more information on these features.
