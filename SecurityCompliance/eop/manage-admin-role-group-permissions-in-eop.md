# Manage admin role group permissions in EOP
  
In Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP), you can use the Exchange admin center (EAC) to make a user a member of a role group or groups in order to assign them permissions to perform specific administrative tasks. You can also remove a user from a role group or groups by using the EAC.
  
## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: 5-10 minutes
    
- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Users, Contacts, and Role Groups" entry in the [Feature permissions in EOP](feature-permissions-in-eop.md) topic. 
    
- Certain permissions in Office 365 map to EOP admin role group permissions. For more information, see the "Role in Exchange Online" column in the "Which services do my Office 365 permissions extend to?" section in [Assigning Admin Roles](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=286708).
    
- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see **Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center**.

### Use the EAC to remove members from admin role groups
