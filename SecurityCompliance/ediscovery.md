# eDiscovery in Office 365

Electronic discovery, or eDiscovery, is the process of identifying and delivering electronic information that can be used as evidence in legal cases. You can use eDiscovery in Office 365 to search for content in Exchange Online mailboxes, Office 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business sites, and Skype for Business conversations. You can search mailboxes and sites in the same eDiscovery search by using the Content Search tool in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center. And you can use eDiscovery cases in the Security &amp; Compliance Center to identify, hold, and export content found in mailboxes and sites. If your organization has an Office 365 E5 subscription, you can further analyze content by using Office 365 Advanced eDiscovery.
  
Office 365 provides the following eDiscovery tools:
  
- [Content Search in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center](ediscovery.md#contentsearch)
    
- [eDiscovery Cases in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center](ediscovery.md#ediscoverycases)
