# Use end-user spam notifications to release and report spam-quarantined messages

If your administrator enables end-user spam notifications, you'll receive a notification message that lists messages intended for your mailbox that were identified as spam and quarantined instead. This message includes the number of spam-quarantined messages listed, and the date and time (in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC)) of the last message in the list. From this list, you can view the following information about each message: 
  
- **Sender** The sender name and email address of the quarantined message. 
    
- **Subject** The subject line text of the quarantined message. 
    
- **Date** The date and time (in UTC) that the message was quarantined. 
    
- **Size** The size of the quarantined message, in kilobytes (KBs). 
    
You can perform the following actions on each message:
  
- **Release to Inbox** Clicking this link sends the message to your inbox where you can view it. 
    
- **Report as Not Junk** Clicking this link sends a copy of the message to Microsoft for analysis. The spam team evaluates and analyzes the message, and, depending on the results of the analysis, adjusts the anti-spam filter rules to allow the message through. 
    
> [!NOTE]
>  Messages that are quarantined due to a transport rule match are not included in end user spam quarantined messages. Only spam-quarantined messages are listed. >  You can only release a message and report it as a false positive (not junk) once.
