# Give users access to the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center

Users need to be assigned permissions in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center before they can manage any of its security or compliance features. As an Office 365 global admin or member of the OrganizationManagement role group in the Security &amp; Compliance Center, you can give these permissions to users. Users will only be able to manage the security or compliance features that you give them access to. 
  
For more information about the different permissions you can give to users in the Security &amp; Compliance Center, check out [Permissions in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center](permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.md).
