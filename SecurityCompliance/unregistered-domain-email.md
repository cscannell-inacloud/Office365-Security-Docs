# Unregistered Domain Email: What you need to know

Office 365 allows for tenants to relay some messages through Exchange Online Protection (EOP). One supported example of this would be when users have an Office 365 mailbox and someone external sends them email but email forwarding is configured so that it goes back out to the user's external mailbox. This is most common in education environments where students want to leverage their personal email interface but still get emails related to school. Another example is when customers are in a hybrid scenario and have on-premise servers that send email out of EOP.

## Problems with unregistered domains

The problem is when on-premise servers get compromised and end up relaying a large volume of spam out of EOP. In almost all cases, the right connectors are set up but email is being sent from unregistered, also known as unprovisioned, domains. Office 365 does allow a reasonable amount of mail to come from unregistered domains, but an Accepted Domain should be configured in the Admin Center for each domain you plan on sending out of.

Once compromised, tenants will be prevented from sending outbound mail for unregistered domains. Users will receive a Non-Delivery Report (NDR) that states:

- 550 5.7.750 Service unavailable. Client blocked from sending from unregistered domains

## Unblocking tenant in order to send again

There are several things you need to do if you get blocked for sending from unregistered domains:

1. Make sure that you register all of your domains in Office 365 admin center. More information can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/manage-accepted-domains/manage-accepted-domains).

2. Lock down your on-premise servers and ensure that they are not compromised. There are many factors involved here, especially if these are third-party servers, but you will need to be able to make sure all mail leaving that server is legitimate.

Once done, you will need to call Microsoft Support and ask to get your tenant unblocked to send from unregistered domains again.  Providing the error code is helpful, but you will need to prove that your environment is secured and that spam will not be sent again.
