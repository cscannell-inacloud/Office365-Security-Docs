## Turn on Office 365 Cloud App Security

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be a global administrator or security administrator to perform the following task. To learn more, see [Permissions in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center](permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.md). In order for Office 365 Cloud App Security to work correct, **audit logging must be turned on** for your Office 365 environment. For more information, see [Turn Office 365 audit log search on or off](turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off.md). 
  
1. As a global administrator or security administrator, go to [https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com) and sign in using your work or school account for Office 365. (This takes you to the Security &amp; Compliance Center.) 
    
2. Go to **Alerts** \> **Manage advanced alerts**.
    
3. Select **Turn on Office 365 Cloud App Security**.
    
4. Choose **Go to Office 365 Cloud App Security**.
    
    ![In the Security &amp; Compliance Center, choose Manage Advanced Alerts to go to Office 365 Cloud App Security](media/958632d4-03e3-4ade-8e22-d5509db6fca7.png)
  
    This takes you to the Office 365 Cloud App Security portal, where you can view reports and create or edit your policies.
    
> [!NOTE]
> When you turn on Office 365 Cloud App Security, auditing information about your Office 365 user accounts and user activities is transferred to [Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://aka.ms/whatiscas). This allows Office 365 to provide advanced alerts, filtering, and other features so you can get information and take action about suspicious activities.
