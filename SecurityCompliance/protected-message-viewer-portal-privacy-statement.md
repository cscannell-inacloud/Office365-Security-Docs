# Office 365 Protected Message Viewer Portal privacy statement

This privacy statement governs the Office 365 Protected Message Viewer Portal (the “Portal”) which enables you to view protected (encrypted) messages on your devices.  It does not apply to other online or offline Microsoft sites, products, or services. Other privacy statements may also apply to the data you process through the Portal, such as the privacy statement for Microsoft Account (if it is used for authentication) or the privacy statement associated with your device.

## Collection, processing, and use of your information

The Portal enables you to view protected messages from Office 365 from a variety of end points (e.g. desktop computers or mobile devices).  An email message will arrive in your mailbox with a hyperlink to view the protected message. When you click on that hyperlink, you will be given options to sign into the Portal using O365, Microsoft Account, Gmail, or Yahoo accounts, to view that message.  You also have an option to use a one-time passcode, depending on the sender’s tenant configuration. The Portal will redirect you to your email provider to authenticate you. After successful authentication, the message will be decrypted and displayed via the Portal.

Sign-in credential information for your email account, as well as the one-time passcode, will be used solely for the purpose of authentication; it will not be stored in the Portal, or used for any other purposes.

During the decryption process, the encrypted mail you receive will not be stored by the Portal; it will not be transmitted outside the Portal at any time.
